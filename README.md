# Comphanny Template `v1.0.0`

View template [here](https://davinaleong.github.io/proj-comphaanyy-template/)!

This is a template of a fake Company I built and designed for a CraftCMS project.

Note that this project doesn't come with a pre-configured SASS compiler.
I was lazy to code up a Webpack or Gulp script for it, so I just used a VS Code extension to do the job ðŸ˜›...

## Tech Stack

- Font Awesome 5
- Bootstrap 4
- SASS

## How to Use

If you just want to adapt template's content, it is usable right out of-the-box.

I designed this template to be simple to integrate with CraftCMS (or Laravel).

Building off this template requires **Bootstrap 4**, SASS, and your own SASS compiler.
